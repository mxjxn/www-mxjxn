excerpt: How I added Keystatic CMS to mxjxn.com so I can edit everything through a nice admin UI instead of pushing code.

## Why

Every time I wanted to update my homepage — change the bio, add a project, tweak the wording — I had to edit the Astro source, commit, and redeploy. That's fine for a developer, but it meant I was only updating the site when I was already in code mode.

## What I picked

I went with Keystatic. It's a Git-based CMS that lives right in the repo — no separate database, no external service. Everything is YAML and Markdown files in `src/content/`. The admin UI is built into the site at `/keystatic`.

## How it works

- **Singletons** for one-off content (hero section, about page)
- **Collections** for repeatable items (skills, projects, links, art, blog posts)
- The Astro site reads everything through Keystatic's reader at build/render time
- Blog posts use Markdoc for rich text — headings, code blocks, lists, all the good stuff

## What's next

Now that the CMS is in place, this blog exists. I'll write here about things I'm building, things I'm learning, and things I'm figuring out.
